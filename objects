Objects in javascript
Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScriptâ€™s primitive data types in the sense.
These primitive data types all store a single value each.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don't actually store the value.
