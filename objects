Objects in javascript
- Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
- These objects are quite different from JavaScriptâ€™s primitive data types in the sense.
- These primitive data types all store a single value each.
- An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
- That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don't actually store the value.
- A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior. For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.
- JavaScript is an object-based language.
- Everything is an object in JavaScript.
- JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.
